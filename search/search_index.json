Specifically, you can either map the service name Mezzio\\Authorization\\AuthorizationInterface to a factory, or alias it to the appropriate service. For instance, using Mezzio container configuration , you could select the mezzio-authorization-acl adapter in either of the following ways: Using an alias: ```php use Mezzio\\Authorization\\AuthorizationInterface; use Mezzio\\Authorization\\Acl\\LaminasAcl; return [ 'dependencies' => [ // Using an alias: 'aliases' => [ AuthorizationInterface::class => LaminasAcl::class, ], ], ]; ``` Mapping to a factory: ```php use Mezzio\\Authorization\\AuthorizationInterface; use Mezzio\\Authorization\\Acl\\LaminasAclFactory; return [ 'dependencies' => [ // Using a factory: 'factories' => [ AuthorizationInterface::class => LaminasAclFactory::class, ], ], ]; ``` We provide two different adapters. The RBAC adapter is provided by mezzio-authorization-rbac . The ACL adapter is provided by mezzio-authorization-acl . Each adapter is installable via Composer : $ composer require mezzio/mezzio-authorization-rbac # or $ composer require mezzio/mezzio-authorization-acl In each adapter, we use the route name as the resource. This means you can specify if a role is authorized to access a specific HTTP route . However, this is just one approach to implementing an authorization system; you can create your own system by implementing the AuthorizationInterface .

An authorization system first needs authentication: to verify that an identity has access to something (i.e., is authorized) we first need the identity , which is provided during authentication. Authentication is provided via the package mezzio-authentication . That library provides an AuthenticationMiddleware class that verify credentials using the HTTP request, and stores the identity via a PSR-7 request attribute . The identity generated by mezzio-authentication is stored as the request attribute Mezzio\\Authentication\\UserInterface as a UserInterface implementation. That interface looks like the following: namespace Mezzio\\Authentication; interface UserInterface { /** * Get the unique user identity (id, username, email address or ...) */ public function getIdentity() : string; /** * Get all user roles * * @return Iterable */ public function getRoles() : iterable; /** * Get a detail $name if present, $default otherwise */ public function getDetail(string $name, $default = null); /** * Get all the details, if any */ public function getDetails() : array; } mezzio-authorization consumes this identity attribute. It checks if a user's role (as retrieved from the UserInterface object) is authorized (granted) to the perform the current HTTP request. Authorization is performed using the isGranted() method of the AuthorizationInterface . We offer two adapters: mezzio-authorization-rbac , which implements Role-Based Access Controls ( RBAC ) mezzio-authorization-acl , which implements an Access Control List ( ACL ).
